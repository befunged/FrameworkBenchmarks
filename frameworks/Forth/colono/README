Colono

Colono is a webserver written in Forth which uses an event-based I/O model.

This version runs under GForth, SwiftForth, and VFX Forth on Linux and under
SwiftForth and VFX Forth on MS Windows.

See doc/colono.html for more information.

Request handlers

Processing HTTP requests is delegated to request handlers. A handler for GET
which sends files is included. Handlers for e.g. POST requests can be added.
This makes it possible to implement a REST API using Forth.

An example for a POST handler can be found in examples/posttest.fs
(posttestwin.fs on Windows). Run this file to try out POST requests.
The HTML file form.html can be used to send a POST request which is sent back
by the handler.
